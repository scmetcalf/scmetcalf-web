				<p><strong> Who? </strong> A short bio, I've been building PCs since I was 7. Looking under the hood of Windows for as long as I can remember with WMI, RPC, SNMP (OS agnostic), and Powershell. Father of two kids, husband of one, I try to sink my teeth into technology during my 'off-hours.'</p>
				<p><strong> What? </strong>This site is hosted in Amazon Web Servers EC2 free tier instance. I am running a LEMP stack with Linux, Nginx, MySQL and PHP.</p>
				<p><strong> Why? </strong> This started as a challenge locally on my PC to see if I could run a VMWare player instance of CentOS hosting NGinx. I then thought, hey, I want to see if I can parse a CURL SSL certificate response. Thus, <a href=".\projects.html">Projects</a> was conceived.</p>
				<p>SSL Checker is a simple program that writes/reads to a locally hosted database <em> (security be damned - - I said I'm running free tier, right?). </em>  It does some basic error handling and runs a CURL on the certificate present and reports back basic info. Here's the Git Repo for the SSL checker!</p>

				<p>Drawing on my decade of experiencing managing infrastructure with designing, pointing, clicking, and scripting tasks, this site is my attempt at adopting a more DevOps culture to my professional skillset!</p>

				<p>What started as an small idea to get an application stack to run NGINX and MySQL turned into a living and breathing entity. Here you will find some projects and ramblings I have about different topics.</p>
